  <h3>Academic</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/academicSeat2.jpg" alt="">
  <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-2" />
  <p class="read-more-wrap">This Seat will suit the Classical Dressage Rider that wants more room in the seat without constriction.  <br><br>
    <span class="read-more-target">
   feel is a jumping seat in that it has a flatter middle that allows the rider to move their seat backwards or forwards more so than would be achievable in say an Extra Deep seat. <br><br>
   The Academic seat benefits from a much higher cantle than the Flat Seat and therefore gives the support one would expect for dressage.</span></p>

  <h3>Grand Prix</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/GPSeat2.jpg" alt="">
  <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />
  <p class="read-more-wrap">Like the Academic seat this Seat will suit the Classical Dressage Rider that wants more room in the seat without constriction.  <span class="read-more-target"><br><br>
    The difference is the cantle is from a Deep seat whereas the Academic is from a Extra Deep. 
      This gives a slightly lower and more round appearance that some customers prefer.  <br><br>
    The feel is like a jumping seat in that it has a flatter middle that allows the rider to move their seat backwards or forwards more so than would be achievable in say an Extra Deep seat.</span></p>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Deep</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/deepSeat2.jpg" alt="">
 <p>Has a round high cantle with belly to give support and aid position. </p> 

<p>Used by dressage riders and show jumpers alike because the seat give a secure central feel.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Extra Deep</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/xDeepSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a very high round cantle with belly to give a deep supportive seat used mainly by dressage riders.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Shallow</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/shallowSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a round shallow cantle with belly to give support and aid position but gives enough room to slide back or over the cantle when jumping.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Continental</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/continentalSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>This seat is derived from the showing saddle seat.</p>
   <p> The seat is wider than the flat (square cantle jumping) and also has a small belly (support at the sides of the cantle.</p>
    <p> The back is square and on the curved tree profile feels deep. </p>
    <p> This seat is rather like the Shallow Seat Profile but has a larger area to sit on as the cantle does not end so sharply.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Flat</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/flatSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a square cantle and no belly. </p>
  <p>  This allows the rider to sit further back in the seat when necessary as it lacks the support at the sides of the seat.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Cross Country (XC)</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/xcSeat.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Cross Country seat has a sloped cantle with no belly support and is shaped in such a way that even sitting right back on the cantle does not make the rider feel pushed away from the horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Stock</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/stockSeat.jpg" alt="">
<p>Has a wider seat with more supportive ‘wrap around’ cantle and generous cup shape allowing more rotation of the pelvis with a support much further back that traditional saddles.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>XD Stock</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/XDStockSeat2.jpg" alt="">
<p>Exactly like the Stock Seat this seat has a wider seat with more supportive ‘wrap around’ cantle and generous cup shape allowing more rotation of the pelvis with a support much further back that traditional saddles. </p>
<p>The XDSTOCK Cantle is rounded in shape to minick that of the Xdeep and therefore looks very similiar when on the horse whilst feeling totally different.</p>
