  <h3>Academic</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/academicSeat2.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="teaser">This Seat will suit the Classical Dressage Rider that wants more room in the seat without constriction. </p> 
  <p class="complete"> feel is a jumping seat in that it has a flatter middle that allows the rider to move their seat backwards or forwards more so than would be achievable in say an Extra Deep seat. </p>
  <p> The Academic seat benefits from a much higher cantle than the Flat Seat and therefore gives the support one would expect for dressage.</p>
 
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Grand Prix</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/GPSeat2.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Like the Academic seat this Seat will suit the Classical Dressage Rider that wants more room in the seat without constriction. </p>
    <p>The difference is the cantle is from a Deep seat whereas the Academic is from a Extra Deep. </p>
     <p> This gives a slightly lower and more round appearance that some customers prefer.  </p>  
     <p>The feel is like a jumping seat in that it has a flatter middle that allows the rider to move their seat backwards or forwards more so than would be achievable in say an Extra Deep seat.</p>

</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Deep</h3>
  <img src="./seatStyles/deepSeat2.jpg" alt="">
 <p>Has a round high cantle with belly to give support and aid position. </p> 

<p>Used by dressage riders and show jumpers alike because the seat give a secure central feel.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Extra Deep</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/xDeepSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a very high round cantle with belly to give a deep supportive seat used mainly by dressage riders.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Shallow</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/shallowSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a round shallow cantle with belly to give support and aid position but gives enough room to slide back or over the cantle when jumping.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Continental</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/continentalSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>This seat is derived from the showing saddle seat.</p>
   <p> The seat is wider than the flat (square cantle jumping) and also has a small belly (support at the sides of the cantle.</p>
    <p> The back is square and on the curved tree profile feels deep. </p>
    <p> This seat is rather like the Shallow Seat Profile but has a larger area to sit on as the cantle does not end so sharply.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Flat</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/flatSeat.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Has a square cantle and no belly. </p>
  <p>  This allows the rider to sit further back in the seat when necessary as it lacks the support at the sides of the seat.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Cross Country (XC)</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/xcSeat.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Cross Country seat has a sloped cantle with no belly support and is shaped in such a way that even sitting right back on the cantle does not make the rider feel pushed away from the horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Stock</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/stockSeat.jpg" alt="">
<p>Has a wider seat with more supportive ‘wrap around’ cantle and generous cup shape allowing more rotation of the pelvis with a support much further back that traditional saddles.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>XD Stock</h3>
  <img src="/seatStyles/XDStockSeat2.jpg" alt="">
<p>Exactly like the Stock Seat this seat has a wider seat with more supportive ‘wrap around’ cantle and generous cup shape allowing more rotation of the pelvis with a support much further back that traditional saddles. </p>
<p>The XDSTOCK Cantle is rounded in shape to minick that of the Xdeep and therefore looks very similiar when on the horse whilst feeling totally different.</p>

<h3 class="heading">Dressage Flaps</h3>
<div class="boxes"> 
<div class="box">
  <h3>Giant High Fixed Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-giant-high-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Dressage Fixed Giant Block is a pure dressage flap. </p>
 <p>  The block is cut higher to give support to the thigh but the cut seems to suit riders with standard to long legs.</p>
 <p> The thinking behind this block is to get your thigh under the block not your knee jammed in it. </p> 
 <p> This is a real must if your horse is big moving.  The more weight you put on the ball of your foot in the stirrup the more you can keep your weight in the seat!  Sounds mad but you should try it!</p>
 <p> Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Equitana</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-equitana.jpg" alt="">
<p>NEW addition to our range of dressage flaps is the Equitana with an adjustable fixed block!
  The Block angle can be adjusted and the position front to back can be moved as well. </p>
  <p> This means that you can achieve the perfect position of the leg every time with different riders. </p>
  <p> We preveiwed a prototype of this flap at Equitana in Essen, Germany in March 2015 and it was very well received.</p>
  <p> 
  The stitch pattern is different and is like our swirl pattern.  The addition of a wear strip at the bottom provides a good looking contrast.  The flap construction is the same as our padded flaps so we have still kept that superior contact and feel you associate with a WOW.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Equitana Thigh Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-equitana-thigh-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>NEW addition to our Equitana flaps –Thigh High Blocks.</p>
<p> These blocks are shorted than traditional Equitana blocks and are suited for those with shorter legs or those who simply wish to have higher thigh support. These blocks come in both high profile and low profile.</p>
 <p> The Block angle can be adjusted and the position front to back can be moved as well.  This means that you can achieve the perfect position of the leg every time with different riders.
  The stitch pattern is different and is like our swirl pattern.
</p> <p>  The addition of a wear strip at the bottom provides a good looking contrast.  The flap construction is the same as our padded flaps so we have still kept that superior contact and feel you associate with a WOW.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Movable Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-movable-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>Description – If you enjoy hacking and maybe even some low level jumping along with your Dressage then this flap is for you. </p>
<p> The moveable block allows you to position the knee support where you prefer. You have a choice of 7 blocks which allow for different leg support for different disciplines.
  Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Giant Fixed Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-giant-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Dressage Giant Fixed Block is a pure dressage flap.  The block is more supportive to the thigh than the standard fixed block flap.</p>
<p>  There is more block at the top of the flap so often suits those riders with shorter thighs.  This flap, like its counterpart the Giant High, will really keep you in the seat when your horse is moving big!</p>
<p> 
  Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Seriously Straight</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-seriously-straight.jpg" alt="">
<p>This is really serious dressage flap for the rider that can really drop from the hip and keep their thigh almost vertical to the ground! </p>
<p> the support and leg position you will get from this flap is superb.  Rider finding this flap comfortable would probably wish to try our “Up & Over Stirrup Leathers that are even further back than the conventional back bar position! </p> 
<p>Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Designer “ON FIRE”</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-designer-on-fire.jpg" alt="">
<p>This flap can have the block from the Giant, Giant High, Standard or Zero. </p>
<p> The design is inspired from all of those very expensive designer handbags!  this really has a added WOW factor and all that beauty does not detract from it function!  It still rides as good as its’ less extravagant partners.</p>
<p>We are happy to quote if you have a design that is even more individual.
  Padded leather versions only.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Standard Fixed Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-standard-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>Dressage Fixed Block flap will suit those riders that are purely into Dressage. It has a clean straight flap that will show off the shoulder of the horse better.  </p>
<p> The knee support is more positive than the Moveable Block Dressage.</p>
<p>Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Thigh Fixed Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-thigh-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Dressage Fixed Thigh Block flap will suit those that do not want knee support but want something to roll the thigh into for stability in the half halts. It will also suit riders with a long upper leg. </p>
 <p> Padded leather versions are available in two stitch styles “Classic” and “Swirl”</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Conventional</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-conventional.jpg" alt="">
<p>Traditional looking dressage flap with a substantial fixed block located under the a soft padded knee roll. The main flap is made from very flexible, heavily oiled butt leather. </p>
<p> Ideal for those that want a more conservative look to their saddle. </p>
<p>This flap only comes in the butt leather version and is a mono flap even though it gives the appearance of a dual flap.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Zero Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/dressage-zero-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>This flap is available in any style of normally fixed block flap i.e. Dressage, VSD, GP & Jumping. The fixed block is replaced by a soft flat padded area for those riders that do not like any blocks. </p>

  <h3>Showing Flaps</h3>

</div>

<h3 class="heading">Jumping Flaps</h3>   
<div class="boxes">  
<div class="box">
  <h3>Fixed Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/jumping-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Jumping Fixed Block flap is a favourite with Show Jumpers giving good support to the thigh above the knee without getting in the way. </p>
<p> The calf block is optional but for the serious rider it does give a positive stop to the leg when needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Movable Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/jumping-movable-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>he Jumping Moveable Block is a close contact jumping flap that offers a moveable thigh support block. You will really feel very secure and very close to the horse. </p>
<p>The block can be removed if you do not require it.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Conventional</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/jumping-conventional.jpg" alt="">
<p>Traditional looking Jumping flap with a small removable block located under the very soft padded knee roll. The heavily oiled butt leather flaps mould quickly to the shape of the horse requiring minimal “breaking in”.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Bramham Show Jumping</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/bramham-show-jumping-flap.jpg" alt="">
<p>Our new additions to the range of Jumping flaps is the Bramham Showjumper and Cross Country!</p>
 <p> The flap is a sleek design made of one moulded piece of leather on the top covering the knee roll and calf block.  This means there are no seams or bumps in the transition between block and flap. </p>
 <p> The block is not as substantial as some of our jumping flaps and would suit a rider looking for a close contact more minimal feeling.  The calf block however is reasonably big and give great support behind the leg.</p>
 <p>The cut of the flaps are the same as our existing Jumping and XC flaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Bramham CX Flap</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/bramham-cx-flap.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Bramham XC is almost identical to its showjumping cousin but the flap styles differ by the XC being 1″ more forward cut than the Showjumper. <p>
 <p>The cut of the flaps are the same as our existing Jumping and XC flaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Cross Country Wedge</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/cross-country-wedge.jpg" alt="">
<p>The wedge block on this flap can suit riders of varying leg length. </p>
<p> essentially there is almost no block and it only comes into play when you are punched forward on landing.  A great close contact flap for cross country.  Back calf block can be optional. </p> 
<p> The Cross Country flap appeals to the eventer or show jumper (especially with long legs) who likes to ride very short. More generous in the front than the show jumper flap and a finer higher thigh block.  </p>
<p>we do not struggle to get the longest of legs in this flap!</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Cross Country 'Tapner'</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/cross-country-tapner.jpg" alt="">
<p> Designed for four times eventer Paul Tapner this is almost the same as the XCW but the block is different giving a support to the top of the thigh almost to the knee. </p>
<p>  Back calf block can be optional.</p>
<p>  The Cross Country flap appeals to the eventer or show jumper (especially with long legs) who likes to ride very short.</p> 
<p> More generous in the front than the show jumper flap and a finer higher thigh block.</p> 
<p>we do not struggle to get the longest of legs in this flap!</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Continental</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/continental-flap.jpg" alt="">
<p>Based on the GP flap but with a more padded knee roll and under flap banana block for more support, this flap gives a cushioned grippy feel for jumping. </p>
<p> The knee rolls are moveable with velcro and there is a large selection to choose from so you can be very minimal or really big dependent on your preference.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h3>Continental Flap and Calf Block</h3>
  <img src="./flaps/continental-flap-with-calf-block.jpg" alt="">
<p>this flap is identical to the Continental but has the addition of a calf block for lower leg security.</p>

    <h3>General Purpose Fixed Block</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/general-puropose-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
  <p>General Purpose Fixed Block flap has a very positive knee block for jumping.
    <p> The GP flap is as forward cut as the Jumping flap.</p>
    <p> At the back edge of the flap it is as straight as the Dressage flap but is 5cm shorter.</p>
    <p>It is an excellent choice for hunters or eventers that do not wish to change flaps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>General Purpose Movable Block</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/general-puropose-movable-block.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The General Purpose Moveable Block flap is truly a multi-discipline flap with the ability to position the knee block for dressage or for proper jumping. </p>
  <p> The GP flap is as forward cut as the Jumping flap but on the back edge it is as straight as the Dressage flap but 5cm shorter.</p>
  <p> It is an excellent choice for young horses or eventers that do not wish to change flaps.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Hunter</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/hunter.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Traditional looking Hunting flap with a small removable block located under the very soft padded knee roll. </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>VSD Fixed Block</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/vsd-fixed-block.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Description – The Very Slightly Dressage Fixed Block flap has a very positive knee block for schooling or jumping. </p>
  <p> The VSD flap is an inch more forward cut than the dressage but is 5cm shorter. </p>
  <p> It is an excellent choice for those with short upper legs or horses that do not have shoulder sufficient for the cut of a GP</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>VSD Movable Block</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/vsd-movable-block.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The Very Slightly Dressage flap is forward enough for jumping whilst straight enough to show off the shoulder. </p>
  <p> This flap makes a great GP for those riders with short legs that do not require as much flap in front as the standard GP flap offers. </p>
  <p>  Used in the most backward position without blocks it will make a very good showing/working hunter style flap</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3>VSD Equitana</h3>
    <img src="./flaps/vsd-equitana.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The Block angle can be adjusted and the position front to back can be moved as well. </p>
  <p> This means that you can achieve the perfect position of the leg every time with different riders.</p>
  <p> Inspired by a request from one of our American Retailers, Patricia Cooper. We previewed a prototype of this flap at Equitana in Essen, Germany in March 2015 and it was very well received.</p>
  <p>The stitch pattern is different and is like our swirl pattern. The addition of a wear strip at the bottom provides a good looking contrast.</p>
  <p>The flap construction is the same as our padded flaps so we have still kept that superior contact and feel you associate with a WOW.</p>
